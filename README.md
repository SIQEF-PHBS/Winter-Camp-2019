The Sargent Institute of Quantitative Economics and Finance (SIQEF) at Peking University HSBC Business School is dedicated to research in macroeconomics, investment, economics, and finance, focusing on the application of quantitative tools such as artificial intelligence and big data in Economic analysis.

The mission of SIQEF is to promote the innovation and development of the frontier areas of quantitative economics and finance theory, and to provide a new theoretical basis for the formulation of macroeconomic policies and the invention of intelligent financial instruments, providing a prospective and professional decision-making reference for a sustainable economic development and macroeconomic policy control.

Professor Thomas Sargent, the 2011 Nobel laureate in Economics, serves as the Director of SIQEF.

Peking University HSBC Business School (PHBS) was founded in 2004 with the intention to advance Peking University (PKU)’s involvement in the global economics, finance, and management research.

Located in Shenzhen, PHBS brings Peking University’s historical presence and first-tier business education programs to the country’s south and benefits from the dynamic and entrepreneurial spirit of the thriving city. As an additional advantage, the proximity to Hong Kong, a world financial hub, provides unmatched opportunities for the entire campus community.

PHBS currently offers a doctoral program, specialized Master’s programs, dual-degree-Master’s programs with the National University of Singapore, a MBA program, an Executive MBA program, and numerous executive development programs.

To provide in-depth Chinese educational experiences with a global perspective, PHBS admits international students into the specialized Master’s and MBA programs. PHBS is accredited for EPAS by EFMD and is in the process of AACSB accreditation.



### [**QuantEcon**](https://quantecon.org/)

QuantEcon is a NumFOCUS fiscally sponsored project dedicated to development and documentation of modern open source computational tools for economics, econometrics, and decision making. We welcome contributions and collaboration from the economics community and other partner organizations.



## 2. Winter Camp Schedule

The Winter Camp provides an 8-day intensive training in Python programming and its applications in Economics. Professor Sargent has designed the Winter Camp classes with a focus on teaching a useful set of quantitative tools used in modern Economics. Roughly, the first 2 days will be devoted to review basic syntax and packages in Python. In the next 3 days, we focus on handing out tools, and in the later 3 days, various applications of the tools in Economics will be covered.

On each day, lectures will be held in the morning from 9:00AM to 12:00PM, and then in the afternoon, from 14:00PM to 17:30PM. Computer lab will remain open between 19:00PM to 22:00PM in the evening for students to do after-class practices and preview for the next day’s classes. After-class practices should be completed and submitted in groups.

## 4. Winter Camp Program



## 5. Ph.D. Program in Quantitative Economics

Starting from Fall 2018, PHBS will establish a state-of-the-art PhD program in quantitative economics focusing on foundations of economics and modern mathematical, statistical, and computer tools for putting those tools to work to analyze economic problems. The program is designed and organized by Professor Thomas Sargent.

Audience: As students, we seek either (a) highly motivated students having undergraduate degrees that provide them with a solid foundation in undergraduate mathematics, probability, and statistics; or (b) recent graduates of good MA programs in economics and finance; or (c) in exceptional cases, smart undergraduates with weaker backgrounds in mathematics and statistics who are willing to do extra remedial work before starting the main courses for the PhD program.

Philosophy: We shall teach mathematical and conceptual foundations of modern economics theory as well econometrics and statistics. Courses will begin by emphasizing tools because that is the most efficient way to create a powerful language for precisely formulating and criticizing economic ideas. After students acquire tools, important applications illustrating the power of economic theories and econometric methods will be presented. A typical first year PhD class will begin with virtually 100% tools, then over the course of the academic year gradually approach 50% tools and 50% applications.
